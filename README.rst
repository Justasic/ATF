ATF
===

The ATF project is designed as a full C++ replacement to the CIA.vc project but brings modernization not possible
from the original CIA.vc source code. Much of the code base will be derived from an old project I worked on
previously to do the same job, ANT_, which was overly complicated and a big mess. This project strives to be
simplistic and powerful.
